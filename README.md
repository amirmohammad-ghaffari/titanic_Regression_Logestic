machine learning


Logistic regression is a learning algorithm and If we want to consider a discrete 
value for continuous data and we want to classify them We will do this with logistic 
regression.
To use this algorithm, we define a cost function And because the use of reduction gradients
is part of this algorithm The cost function should be convex so as not to get stuck in the 
local minimum And then we find the parameters with the reduction gradient algorithm(theta),
And specify the new class.

To show this regression, I used the famous Titanic dataset And to reduce the complexity,
I only used columns survived , pclass , sex ,age
